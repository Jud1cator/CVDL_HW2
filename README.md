# Cool README
This repository contains basic guidlines on how to create prototypes for object detection and instance segmentation fast. The idea is to use Supervisely and Roboflow platforms which allow you to create object detection, instance segmenetation and other types of datasets. Also those platforms provide model zoo, where you can choose and train model on your dataset with Google Colab (Roboflow) or on your PC inside nvidia docker (Supervisely).

The procedure is outlined in `cvdl_hw2_report.pdf`

.ipynb notebooks contain code from Roboflow to train and evaluate YOLO models.

And here is the guide on how to train Mask R-CNN with Supervisely (literally 0 effort): https://legacy.docs.supervise.ly/neural-networks/examples/mask_rcnn/
